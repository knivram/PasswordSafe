# Security Concept for PasswordSafe

This document outlines the security architecture and cryptographic mechanisms
implemented in the PasswordSafe application to protect user secrets.

## 1. Overview

PasswordSafe is designed as a secure password management application that
follows the principle of zero-knowledge architecture. This means that all
sensitive data is encrypted on the client side, and the server never has access
to unencrypted user secrets or master passwords.

## 2. Authentication and Identity Management

- **Third-Party Authentication**: The application uses
  [Clerk](https://clerk.com/) for user authentication and identity management,
  which provides secure authentication flows and session management.
- **Multi-layered Authentication**: Users authenticate first with Clerk, and
  then with a master password that never leaves the client.

## 3. Key Management

### 3.1 Key Generation and Storage

- **Key Pair Generation**: Upon user registration, a unique RSA key pair
  (4096-bit) is generated in the browser using the Web Crypto API.
- **Master Password**: Users create a master password that never gets
  transmitted to the server.
- **Key Encryption Key (KEK)**: The master password is used to derive a Key
  Encryption Key using PBKDF2:
  - Salt: Randomly generated 16-byte value
  - Iterations: 100,000 (high iteration count to resist brute force attacks)
  - Hash: SHA-256
  - Output: 256-bit AES-GCM key

### 3.2 Private Key Protection

- The user's private key is wrapped (encrypted) using AES-GCM with the derived
  KEK
- Only the encrypted private key, public key, and salt are stored on the server
- The private key is only available in memory after the user enters their master
  password

### 3.3 Key Lifecycle

- The private key is loaded into the browser's memory only after successful
  authentication with the master password
- The KeyStore context manages the state of cryptographic keys and clears them
  when the user logs out

## 4. Vault Management

- Vaults are containers that hold user secrets
- Each vault has its own wrapped key that can only be unwrapped using the user's
  private key
- This provides an additional layer of compartmentalization for secrets

## 5. Secrets Encryption

- User secrets are encrypted using the vault's key
- Only the owner with the corresponding private key can decrypt the vault's key
  and with it all secrets
- Encrypted data is stored in the database and cannot be decrypted by system
  administrators

## 6. Database Security

- **Data Segregation**: User data is properly segregated using user IDs
- **No Plaintext Secrets**: All sensitive data is stored encrypted in the
  database
- **Minimized Data Storage**: Only the minimum required data is stored

## 7. Implementation Security Controls

### 7.1 Client-side Controls

- **Web Crypto API**: Uses the browser's native cryptographic API rather than
  JavaScript implementations
- **No Key Export**: Private keys are marked as non-exportable where appropriate
- **Memory Management**: Sensitive data is cleared from memory when no longer
  needed

### 7.2 Key Derivation Security

- **Strong Salt**: Random 16-byte salt for each user
- **High Iteration Count**: 100,000 iterations for PBKDF2 to slow down brute
  force attacks
- **Modern Algorithms**: Uses SHA-256 and AES-GCM for key derivation and
  encryption

## 8. Transmission Security

- **HTTPS/TLS**: All communications between client and server occur over
  encrypted connections
- **No Sensitive Data Transmission**: Master passwords and unencrypted secrets
  never leave the client

## 9. Security Considerations and Recommendations

### 9.1 Known Limitations

- Browser memory security limitations
- Potential vulnerability to certain client-side attacks

### 9.2 Recommendations

- **Regular Security Audits**: Conduct regular security audits of the
  application
- **Key Rotation**: Implement mechanisms for key rotation
- **Backup Strategy**: Provide secure backup options for user keys
- **Strong Password Requirements**: Enforce strong master password requirements
- **Two-Factor Authentication**: Consider adding additional 2FA for critical
  operations
